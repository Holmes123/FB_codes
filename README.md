Code released in Python Programmers Society on Facebook.

Some of the code published here are merely small code snippets used to illustrate basic functions in Python. 
I do hope that these small snippets will be helpful to newcomers on Python, and that you may learn from these examples.


Feel free to use the published code on this page.
